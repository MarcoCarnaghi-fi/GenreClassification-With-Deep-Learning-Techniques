# GenreClassification-With-Deep-Learning-Techniques


Colab notebook developed to design, train and test three DL architectures with the aim of achieving a Genre Classifier of reduced number of layers.
The three developed models are: CNN, RNN and CRNN.
All of them were trained using the GZTAN dataset.
You can find a more in depth explanation of the project, its context and reasons of design decision in the Colab file itself or the pdf of the paper submitted to 
CASE 2022 conference of Argentina.
